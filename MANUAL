PROJECT: PbP Posting Tool

DESCRIPTION:
This tool generates BBCode for forum posts.
It is designed to help playing Forum-PbP (Play By Post) Roleplaying games.
When all posts have the same style (color for "talking"/"ooc" etc) it will result in an overall better readability.

INSTRUCTIONS:
To customize the BBCode, edit the file "res/settings.js":
*code_char  : code for Charactername
*code_speak	: code for Speaking
*code_think	: code for Thinking
*code_ooc	: code for OOC
The term in the variable "code_tag" is the one which will be replaced by the entry of the user.
