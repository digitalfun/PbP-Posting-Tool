PROJECT: PbP Posting Tool

DESCRIPTION:
This tool generates BBCode for forum posts.
It is designed to help playing Forum-PbP (Play By Post) Roleplaying games.
When all posts have the same style (color for "talking"/"ooc" etc) it will result in an overall better readability.

INSTRUCTIONS:
To customize the BBCode, edit the file "res/settings.js":
*code_char  : code for Charactername
*code_speak	: code for Speaking
*code_think	: code for Thinking
*code_ooc	: code for OOC
The term in the variable "code_tag" is the one which will be replaced by the entry of the user.

FILES:
*html*
main: postingtool.html
*resource*
email image: res/contact.gif
icon: res/roll.gif
icon: res/talk.gif
icon: res/think.gif
css: res/postingtool.css
*js*
res/multilanguage.js
res/postingtool.js
res/settings.js

EXTENSIONS:
There is an extension called "ds" which is the one I used to play on Dungeonslayers.net.
We use this as an example.

To create an extension:
STEP 1: create a copy the main-file "postingtool.html" and name it to represent your extension (ex: postingtool_ds.html).
STEP 2: create an extension code file (js): The extension code belongs to a new file in the "ext" folder. (ex: /ext/ds.js) and has the following structure.
[code]
extension.create_extension( function() {
  YOUR CODE BELONGS HERE
});
[/code]

STEP 3: edit your copy of main source ("postingtool_ds.html") and un-comment the line where it includes the extension-script and change the name of the js-file to match your extension code file.
[code]
  <!-- extension -->
	<!--          REMOVE THIS LINE
	<script		type="text/javascript"
				src="ds.js">
	</script>
	-->           REMOVE THIS LINE
[/code]

STEP 4: edit your extension code file and overwrite the functions for code creation or use jQuery to change/add the tool.
(see "ds.js" to get some input)
